# Torzu-AppImage üêß

This repository makes builds for **aarch64**, **x86_64** (generic) and **x86_64_v3**. If your CPU is less than 10 years old use the x86_64_v3 build since it has a significant performance boost.

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend these alternatives instead: 

* [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `am -i torzu` or `appman -i torzu`

* [dbin](https://github.com/xplshn/dbin) `dbin install torzu.appimage`

* [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) `soar install torzu`

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead, it can also work without fuse at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)
